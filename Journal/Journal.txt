Week- 1

When it comes to using AI this week, I didn't really use it much. We covered Gemini in class, but I haven't had the chance yet to play around with it. For the progress that I have made thus far on the lab for week 1, I have not had to use AI. I did however notice that as I am completing each question, the AI that is built into Google Colab (Gemini?) automatically tries to fill in the code for me based on what the instructions are asking and what I have begun to input. Some of it is helpful and some isn't. Especially as someone who is still trying to get hang of the basics, I feel like it doesn't give me a complete chance to do it on my own, so I ignore it as best I can, but use it if I fell like I am getting stuck, while also having it explain what I am doing wrong so I can fix it.

Week - 1

When it comes to using AI this week, I didn't really use it much. We covered Gemini in class, but I haven't had the chance yet to play around with it. For the progress that I have made thus far on the lab for week 1, I have not had to use AI. I did however notice that as I am completing each question, the AI that is built into Google Colab (Gemini?) automatically tries to fill in the code for me based on what the instructions are asking and what I have begun to input. Some of it is helpful and some isn't. Especially as someone who is still trying to get hang of the basics, I feel like it doesn't give me a complete chance to do it on my own, so I ignore it as best I can, but use it if I fell like I am getting stuck, while also having it explain what I am doing wrong so I can fix it. 

Week - 2

This week, I utulized AI, specifically ChatGPT to explore more about my hair products that I use and how they help my hair type. I also used it in my week 2 expercies, both Gemini and Chat to give me more problems to answer and practice with, while not providing any direct answers so that I can learn and become better at coding overall.

Week - 3 

During week 3 I used AI, specifically chatGPT a few times. First, my October RA bulletin boards
are due and I needed a title for this months critical messaging information that related to my theme
of my floor and mental health. I asked chatGPT based on my floor theme and the theme of October
critial messaging good title ideas that were short and fun. I ended up getting "Destination: YOU". 
I also used it to describe to me how specific skills for an internship I am interested in relates
to the current work experience I have as I develop my resume to specific internship opportinities. 
Lastly, I used Gemini and ChatGPT to explain areas of Lab 2 and parts of Lab 3 providing examples and practice.
More specifically, I asked it to give me a list of basic projects that I can work on during my own time
to get better at coding in VSCode and using Python. 

Week - 4

This week I used AI in my discussion board post. I chose option 3 where I asked AI to genrate
a Class for an object of my choice. In this I decided to ask Chat to make a class for a bed. It 
was interesting to see what it came up with as it was for the most part very detailed and included
everything that it needed to in terms of functions and methods. I would personally add more to it though
to expand on its functionality overall. I also used AI to generate a few more examples for personal
understanding of classes and objects.
